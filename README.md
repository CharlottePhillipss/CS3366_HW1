C:

The biggest issue with this elevator is the number placement. The ordering of the numbers listed seems unintuitive and more random, which could potentially confuse users. Also, the emergency call button is not as clearly defined as it could be. It appears to be the roughly the same size, shape, and color as the other buttons. If there is an instance in which a user is having a medical emergency and are suffering from confusion, they may not be able to tell from a glance which button is the emergency button.

The most common uses of an elevator include:

  •	Moving from one floor to another in a large building
  
  •	Assisting disabled people who cannot use stairs
  
More rare uses of an elevator include:

  •	Moving large cargo, such as suitcases and heavy appliances, between the floors of a building.
  
The common sequence of actions for using an elevator are:
  1.	The user decides if they want to move up or down floors, and press the appropriate button.
  2.	The elevator door opens and the user steps inside the elevator.
  3.	The user looks at the elevator interface to find the button for the floor they wish to be on.
  4.	The user presses the button for the correct floor.
  5.	The user waits for the elevator to move.
  6.	The user waits for the elevator doors to open.
  7.	The user exits the elevator.
  
The elevator supports the user in figuring out how to make it work by labeling which buttons do what function, and by changing the lights on the buttons to indicate which ones are active. For instance, the button labeled “1” lighting up red will indicate to the user that the elevator is moving towards the 1st floor.

The elevator provides feedback to the user by not only showing lights to indicate which buttons are active, but by also displaying which floor the elevator is currently on. Most elevators will have a screen that changes numbers as the elevator moves, which will tell the user what floor they are on, and whether or not the elevator is moving up or down.

Common mistakes made with this current design of the elevator would be mixing up the floor numbers. Since the floor numbers aren’t arranged in an order that is easy to read at a glance, users who aren’t paying close attention may accidently push the wrong button and will have to wait for the elevator to move through multiple floors before arriving to the correct one. Another common mistake would be confusing the functions of certain buttons. The bell button and emergency button have different functions, but the specific functions of these buttons can be unclear, and a user might end up using the wrong button for their situation.
